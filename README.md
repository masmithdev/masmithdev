## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael (@masmithdev)
**.Net developer by day, and hobbie everything-else developer in my spare time.**

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Norwich (UK) based.

I have a keen interest in JavaScript, and am currently working on a full-stack project consisting of (and learning of):
- User-facing mobile application built using **React Native**,
- API backend using **Express.js** and (possibly) **PostgreSQL** (non-public),
- Admin tools built in standalone **React**, and
- Anything else that crops up along the way
